This chapter introduces three R/Bioconductor packages developed during the doctoral project. These tools are complementary and together they are able to perform a deep integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data from different databases, from the data acquisition stage to the integrative analysis.

First, to deal with the problem of data acquisition and analysis we created the   R/Bioconductor  TCGAbiolinks package which searches, downloads and organizes data and metadata from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC). Second, to deal with the problem of integrative analysis, we worked closely with Dr. Benjamin P. Berman group to create a new version of the R/Bioconductor ELMER package, which infers regulatory element landscapes and transcription factor  networks from cancer methylomes \cite{yao2015inferring}. This version not only was greatly improved in terms of stability, performance, and extensibility, but it also added a number of new features.
Finally, to improve the usability of the tools developed, we used the R web application framework shiny \cite{shiny} to create the R/Bioconductor TCGAbiolinksGUI package, which provides a graphical interface to ours and several Bioconductor packages.
