\section{Conclusions}


The main goal of this project has been to develop tools and workflows to perform integrative analysis as well as their application in the analysis of public cancer data. The motivations came from the fact that integrating data from different databases, stored in different formats and with different biological meanings is a complex process from both a computational point of view by dealing with big datasets which requires an optimized use of computational resources as well as from a biological point of view for dealing with a biological process still under study, often unknown, or even without a scientific consensus.

\section{Future Works}


\section{Publications, presentations and softwares of the Doctorate Period}

The work produced during the Doctorate period in form of scientific articles,
softwares and conference presentations is shown in the next subsections. 
The published scientific articles were divided into two groups, one with the  first authorship ones, and the other with the co-authorship ones. Those are listed in the following subsection: "First-authored papers", "Co-authored papers","First-authored softwares" and "Co-authored softwares".
The subsection "workshops and workflows" contains all the material created to help users to use the developed tools. Finally, the subsection "Conferences \& presentations" list all oral and poster presentations in international and national conferences.
