@article{TCGAbiolinks,
	Abstract = {The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network has made public a large collection of clinical and molecular phenotypes of more than 10 000 tumor patients across 33 different tumor types. Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.},

	Abstract = {Gliomas are a heterogenous group of brain tumors with distinct biological and clinical properties. Despite advances in surgical techniques and clinical regimens, treatment of high-grade glioma remains challenging and carries dismal rates of therapeutic success and overall survival. Challenges include the molecular complexity of gliomas as well as inconsistencies in histopathological grading, resulting in an inaccurate prediction of disease progression and failure of standard therapy. The updated 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the centrol nervous system reflects a refinement of tumor diagnostics by integrating genotypic and phenotypic features, thereby narrowing defined subgroups. The new classification recommends the molecular diagnosis of IDH mutational status in gliomas. IDH-mutant gliomas are prompt to manifest the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (G-CIMP). Notably, the recent identification of clinically relevant subsets of G-CIMP tumors (G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low) provided a further refinement in glioma classification that is independent of grade and histology. This scheme is useful for predicting patient outcome and may be translated into effective therapeutic strategies tailored to each patient. In the present review, we highlight the evolution of our understanding of G-CIMP subsets and how recent advances in characterizing gliomas{\textquoteright} genome and epigenome may influence future basic and translational research.},

@article{Lingutjnl-2017-314607,
	Abstract = {Objectives Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and adenocarcinoma (OAC) are distinct cancers in terms of a number of clinical and epidemiological characteristics, complicating the design of clinical trials and biomarker developments. We analysed 1048 oesophageal tumour-germline pairs from both subtypes, to characterise their genomic features, and biological and clinical significance.Design Previously exome-sequenced samples were re-analysed to identify significantly mutated genes (SMGs) and mutational signatures. The biological functions of novel SMGs were investigated using cell line and xenograft models. We further performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq to characterise epigenetic alterations.Results OSCC and OAC displayed nearly mutually exclusive sets of driver genes, indicating that they follow independent developmental paths. The combined sample size allowed the statistical identification of a number of novel subtype-specific SMGs, mutational signatures and prognostic biomarkers. Particularly, we identified a novel mutational signature similar to Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC)signature 16, which has prognostic value in OSCC. Two newly discovered SMGs, CUL3 and ZFP36L2, were validated as important tumour-suppressors specific to the OSCC subtype. We further identified their additional loss-of-function mechanisms. CUL3 was homozygously deleted specifically in OSCC and other squamous cell cancers (SCCs). Notably, ZFP36L2 is associated with super-enhancer in healthy oesophageal mucosa; DNA hypermethylation in its super-enhancer reduced active histone markers in squamous cancer cells, suggesting an epigenetic inactivation of a super-enhancer-associated SCC suppressor.Conclusions These data comprehensively contrast differences between OSCC and OAC at both genomic and epigenomic levels, and reveal novel molecular features for further delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment strategies for these cancers.},

	Abstract = {Background: The GDC (Genomic Data Commons) data portal provides users with data from cancer genomics studies. Recently, we developed the R/Bioconductor TCGAbiolinks package, which allows users to search, download and prepare cancer genomics data for integrative data analysis. The use of this package requires users to have advanced knowledge of R thus limiting the number of users. Results: To overcome this obstacle and improve the accessibility of the package by a wider range of users, we developed TCGAbiolinksGUI that uses shiny graphical user interface (GUI) available through the R/Bioconductor package. Conclusion: The TCGAbiolinksGUI package is freely available within the Bioconductor project at http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinksGUI/. Links to the GitHub repository, a demo version of the tool, a docker image and PDF/video tutorials are available at http://bit.do/TCGAbiolinksDocs.},

@article{Gra69,
	Abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

	Abstract = {Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined ?network motifs,? patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

@article{Ben95,
	Abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate ({FWER}). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Nic11,
	Abstract = {High-throughput biological data, whether generated as sequencing, transcriptional microarrays, proteomic, or other means, continues to require analytic methods that address its high dimensional aspects. Because the computational part of data analysis ultimately identifies shape characteristics in the organization of data sets, the mathematics of shape recognition in high dimensions continues to be a crucial part of data analysis. This article introduces a method that extracts information from high-throughput microarray data and, by using topology, provides greater depth of information than current analytic techniques. The method, termed Progression Analysis of Disease (PAD), first identifies robust aspects of cluster analysis, then goes deeper to find a multitude of biologically meaningful shape characteristics in these data. Additionally, because PAD incorporates a visualization tool, it provides a simple picture or graph that can be used to further explore these data. Although PAD can be applied to a wide range of high-throughput data types, it is used here as an example to analyze breast cancer transcriptional data. This identified a unique subgroup of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers that express high levels of c-MYB and low levels of innate inflammatory genes. These patients exhibit 100% survival and no metastasis. No supervised step beyond distinction between tumor and healthy patients was used to identify this subtype. The group has a clear and distinct, statistically significant molecular signature, it highlights coherent biology but is invisible to cluster methods, and does not fit into the accepted classification of Luminal A/B, Normal-like subtypes of ER+ breast cancers. We denote the group as c-MYB+ breast cancer.},

This variability is linked to stochasticity in gene expression, which is generally viewed as having detrimental effects on cellular function with potential implications for disease. However, stochasticity in gene expression can also be advantageous. It can provide the flexibility needed by cells to adapt to fluctuating environments or respond to sudden stresses, and a mechanism by which population heterogeneity can be established during cellular differentiation and development.},

	Abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour1, 2, 3. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70?80\% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it4, 5. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used {DNA} microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of {BRCA1} carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

These areas include text processing of internet documents, gene expression array analysis, and combinatorial chemistry. The objective of variable selection is three-fold: improving the prediction performance of the predictors, providing faster and more cost-effective predictors, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data. The contributions of this special issue cover a wide range of aspects of such problems: providing a better definition of the objective function, feature construction, feature ranking, multivariate feature selection, efficient search methods, and feature validity assessment methods.},

	Abstract = {<p>\&nbsp;Research on so-called \&lsquo;Big Data\&rsquo; has received a considerable momentum and is expected to grow in the future. One very interesting stream of research on Big Data analyzes online networks. Many online networks are known to have some typical macro-characteristics, such as \&lsquo;small world\&rsquo; properties. Much less is known about underlying micro-processes leading to these properties. The models used by Big Data researchers usually are inspired by mathematical ease of exposition. We propose to follow in addition a different strategy that leads to knowledge about micro-processes that match with actual online behavior. This knowledge can then be used for the selection of mathematically-tractable models of online network formation and evolution. Insight from social and behavioral research is needed for pursuing this strategy of knowledge generation about micro-processes. Accordingly, our proposal points to a unique role that social scientists could play in Big Data research</p>

	Abstract = {Ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) technologies offer the potential to interrogate transcriptomes in detail that has traditionally been restricted to single gene surveys. For instance, it is now possible to globally define transcription start sites, polyadenylation signals, alternative splice sites and generate quantitative data on gene transcript accumulation in single tissues or cell types. These technologies are thus paving the way for whole genome transcriptomics and will undoubtedly lead to novel insights into plant development and biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, several challenges exist to making this technology broadly accessible to the plant research community. These include the current need for a computationally intensive analysis of data sets, a lack of standardized alignment and formatting procedures and a relatively small number of analytical software packages to interpret UHTS outputs. In this review we summarize recent findings from UHTS and discuss potential opportunities and challenges for broad adoption of these technologies in the plant science community.},

	Abstract = {Graphs consisting of points, and lines or arrows as connections between selected pairs of points, are used to formulate hypotheses about relations between variables. Points stand for variables, connections represent associations. When a missing connection is interpreted as a conditional independence, the graph characterizes a conditional independence structure as well. Statistical models, called graphical chain models, correspond to special types of graphs which are interpreted in this fashion. Examples are used to illustrate how conditional independences are reflected in summary statistics derived from the models and how the graphs help to identify analogies and equivalences between different models. Graphical chain models are shown to provide a unifying concept for many statistical techniques that in the past have proven to be useful in analyses of data. They also provide tools for new types of analysis.},

	Abstract = {To gain insight into how genomic information is translated into cellular and developmental programs, the Drosophila model organism Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (modENCODE) project is comprehensively mapping transcripts, histone modifications, chromosomal proteins, transcription factors, replication proteins and intermediates, and nucleosome properties across a developmental time course and in multiple cell lines. We have generated more than 700 data sets and discovered protein-coding, noncoding, RNA regulatory, replication, and chromatin elements, more than tripling the annotated portion of the Drosophila genome. Correlated activity patterns of these elements reveal a functional regulatory network, which predicts putative new functions for genes, reveals stage- and tissue-specific regulators, and enables gene-expression prediction. Our results provide a foundation for directed experimental and computational studies in Drosophila and related species and also a model for systematic data integration toward comprehensive genomic and functional annotation.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning was applied for the automated derivation of causal influences in cellular signaling networks. This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.},

@article{Sim11,
	Abstract = {The inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is a difficult problem because the performance of the inference algorithms depends on a multitude of different factors. In this paper we study two of these. First, we investigate the influence of discrete mutual information ({MI}) estimators on the global and local network inference performance of the {C3NET} algorithm. More precisely, we study different {MI} estimators (Empirical, {Miller-Madow}, Shrink and {Sch\"{u}rmann-Grassberger}) in combination with discretization methods (equal frequency, equal width and global equal width discretization). We observe the best global and local inference performance of {C3NET} for the {Miller-Madow} estimator with an equal width discretization. Second, our numerical analysis can be considered as a systems approach because we simulate gene expression data from an underlying gene regulatory network, instead of making a distributional assumption to sample thereof. We demonstrate that despite the popularity of the latter approach, which is the traditional way of studying {MI} estimators, this is in fact not supported by simulated and biological expression data because of their heterogeneity. Hence, our study provides guidance for an efficient design of a simulation study in the context of network inference, supporting a systems approach.},

	Abstract = {Recent years have seen much interest in the study of systems characterized by multiple interacting components. A class of statistical models called graphical models, in which graphs are used to represent probabilistic relationships between variables, provides a framework for formal inference regarding such systems. In many settings, the object of inference is the network structure itself. This problem of ?network inference? is well known to be a challenging one. However, in scientific settings there is very often existing information regarding network connectivity. A natural idea then is to take account of such information during inference. This article addresses the question of incorporating prior information into network inference. We focus on directed models called Bayesian networks, and use Markov chain Monte Carlo to draw samples from posterior distributions over network structures. We introduce prior distributions on graphs capable of capturing information regarding network features including edges, classes of edges, degree distributions, and sparsity. We illustrate our approach in the context of systems biology, applying our methods to network inference in cancer signaling.},

Expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) is well-known to be upregulated in BLBC. The forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) transcription factor, an important prognostic biomarker specific for BLBC, has been shown to be induced by EGF and is critical for EGF effects in breast cancer cells. How FOXC1 is transcriptionally activated in BLBC is not clear.},

	Abstract = {Genome annotation is critical to understand the function of disease variants, especially for clinical applications. To meet this need there are segmentations available from public consortia reflecting varying unsupervised approaches to functional annotation based on epigenetics data, but there remains a need for transparent, reproducible, and easily interpreted genomic maps of the functional biology of chromatin. We introduce here methods for defining chromatin state with a combinatorial epigenomic model using an annotation tool, StatePaintR and a website database, StateHub. Annotations are fully documented with change history and versioning, authorship information, and original source files. The tool calculates quantitative state scores based on genome-wide ranking, allowing prioritization and enrichment testing, facilitating quantitative analysis. StateHub hosts annotation tracks for major public consortia as a resource, and allows users to submit their own alternative models.},

Changes in the new edition include: \&\#183;Stronger focus on MCMC\&\#183;Revision of the computational advice in Part III\&\#183;New chapters on nonlinear models and decision analysis\&\#183;Several additional applied examples from the authors' recent research\&\#183;Additional chapters on current models for Bayesian data analysis such as nonlinear models, generalized linear mixed models, and more\&\#183;Reorganization of chapters 6 and 7 on model checking and data collectionBayesian computation is currently at a stage where there are many reasonable ways to compute any given posterior distribution. However, the best approach is not always clear ahead of time. Reflecting this, the new edition offers a more pluralistic presentation, giving advice on performing computations from many perspectives while making clear the importance of being aware that there are different ways to implement any given iterative simulation computation. The new approach, additional examples, and updated information make Bayesian Data Analysis an excellent introductory text and a reference that working scientists will use throughout their professional life.}},

@article{Wil06,
	Abstract = {As a powerful tool for analyzing full conditional (in-)dependencies between random variables, graphical models have become increasingly popular to infer genetic networks based on gene expression data. However, full (unconstrained) conditional relationships between random variables can be only estimated accurately if the number of observations is relatively large in comparison to the number of variables, which is usually not fulfilled for high-throughput genomic data. Recently, simplified graphical modeling approaches have been proposed to determine dependencies between gene expression profiles. For sparse graphical models such as genetic networks, it is assumed that the zero- and first-order conditional independencies still reflect reasonably well the full conditional independence structure between variables. Moreover, low-order conditional independencies have the advantage that they can be accurately estimated even when having only a small number of observations. Therefore, using only zero- and first-order conditional dependencies to infer the complete graphical model can be very useful. Here, we analyze the statistical and probabilistic properties of these low-order conditional independence graphs (called 0-1 graphs). We find that for faithful graphical models, the 0-1 graph contains at least all edges of the full conditional independence graph (concentration graph). For simple structures such as Markov trees, the 0-1 graph even coincides with the concentration graph. Furthermore, we present some asymptotic results and we demonstrate in a simulation study that despite their simplicity, 0-1 graphs are generally good estimators of sparse graphical models. Finally, the biological relevance of some applications is summarized.},

This framework exploits first-order conditional independence relationships among gene-expression measurements to estimate patterns of association. We use this approach to estimate a coexpression network from microarray gene-expression measurements from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate the biological utility of this approach by showing that a large number of metabolic pathways are coherently represented in the estimated network. We describe a complementary unsupervised graph search algorithm for discovering locally distinct subgraphs of a large weighted graph. We apply this algorithm to our coexpression network model and show that subgraphs found using this approach correspond to particular biological processes or contain representatives of distinct gene families.},

Each pathway usually involves many genes, such as enzymes, which can themselves participate in many pathways. The set of all known pathways can therefore be represented by a complex network of genes. Searching for regularities in the set of gene expression profiles with respect to the topology of this gene network is a way to automatically extract active pathways and their associated patterns of activity.},

	Abstract = {Endeavour (http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/endeavourweb; this web site is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement) is a web resource for the prioritization of candidate genes. Using a training set of genes known to be involved in a biological process of interest, our approach consists of (i) inferring several models (based on various genomic data sources), (ii) applying each model to the candidate genes to rank those candidates against the profile of the known genes and (iii) merging the several rankings into a global ranking of the candidate genes. In the present article, we describe the latest developments of Endeavour. First, we provide a web-based user interface, besides our Java client, to make Endeavour more universally accessible. Second, we support multiple species: in addition to Homo sapiens, we now provide gene prioritization for three major model organisms: Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Caenorhabditis elegans. Third, Endeavour makes use of additional data sources and is now including numerous databases: ontologies and annotations, protein?protein interactions, cis-regulatory information, gene expression data sets, sequence information and text-mining data. We tested the novel version of Endeavour on 32 recent disease gene associations from the literature. Additionally, we describe a number of recent independent studies that made use of Endeavour to prioritize candidate genes for obesity and Type II diabetes, cleft lip and cleft palate, and pulmonary fibrosis.},

                The flood of genome-wide data generated by high-throughput technologies currently provides biologists with an unprecedented opportunity: to manipulate, query, and reconstruct functional molecular networks of cells. Here, we outline three underlying principles and six strategies to infer network models from genomic data. Then, using cancer as an example, we describe experimental and computational approaches to infer "differential" networks that can identify genes and processes driving disease phenotypes. In conclusion, we discuss how a network-level understanding of cancer can be used to predict drug response and guide therapeutics.

	Abstract = {Motivation: Hunting disease genes is a problem of primary importance in biomedical research. Biologists usually approach this problem in two steps: first a set of candidate genes is identified using traditional positional cloning or high-throughput genomics techniques; second, these genes are further investigated and validated in the wet lab, one by one. To speed up discovery and limit the number of costly wet lab experiments, biologists must test the candidate genes starting with the most probable candidates. So far, biologists have relied on literature studies, extensive queries to multiple databases and hunches about expected properties of the disease gene to determine such an ordering. Recently, we have introduced the data mining tool {ENDEAVOUR} (Aerts et al., 2006), which performs this task automatically by relying on different genome-wide data sources, such as Gene Ontology, literature, microarray, sequence and {more.Results}: In this article, we present a novel kernel method that operates in the same setting: based on a number of different views on a set of training genes, a prioritization of test genes is obtained. We furthermore provide a thorough learning theoretical analysis of the method's guaranteed performance. Finally, we apply the method to the disease data sets on which {ENDEAVOUR} (Aerts et al., 2006) has been benchmarked, and report a considerable improvement in empirical {performance.Availability}: The {MATLAB} code used in the empirical results will be made publicly {available.Contact}:tijl.debie@gmail.com or yves.moreau@esat.kuleuven.be},

	Abstract = {The identification of genes involved in health and disease remains a challenge. We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour, to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these phenomena. Unlike previous approaches, ours generates distinct prioritizations for multiple heterogeneous data sources, which are then integrated, or fused, into a global ranking using order statistics. In addition, it offers the flexibility of including additional data sources. Validation of our approach revealed it was able to efficiently prioritize 627 genes in disease data sets and 76 genes in biological pathway sets, identify candidates of 16 mono- or polygenic diseases, and discover regulatory genes of myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the approach identified a novel gene involved in craniofacial development from a {2-Mb} chromosomal region, deleted in some patients with {DiGeorge}-like birth defects. The approach described here offers an alternative integrative method for gene discovery.},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical method for estimating gene networks and detecting promoter elements simultaneously. When estimating a network from gene expression data alone, a common problem is that the number of microarrays is limited compared to the number of variables in the network model, making accurate estimation a difficult task. Our method overcomes this problem by integrating the microarray gene expression data and the {DNA} sequence information into a Bayesian network model. The basic idea of our method is that, if a parent gene is a transcription factor, its children may share a consensus motif in their promoter regions of the {DNA} sequences. Our method detects consensus motifs based on the structure of the estimated network, then re-estimates the network using the result of the motif detection. We continue this iteration until the network becomes stable. To show the effectiveness of our method, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations and applied our method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae data as a real application. Contact: tamada@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp},

<title>Background</title>
<p>Systems biology has embraced computational modeling in response to the quantitative nature and increasing scale of contemporary data sets. The onslaught of data is accelerating as molecular profiling technology evolves. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) is a community effort to catalyze discussion about the design, application, and assessment of systems biology models through annual reverse-engineering challenges.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title>
<p>We describe our assessments of the four challenges associated with the third DREAM conference which came to be known as the DREAM3 challenges: signaling cascade identification, signaling response prediction, gene expression prediction, and the DREAM3 <italic>in silico</italic> network challenge. The challenges, based on anonymized data sets, tested participants in network inference and prediction of measurements. Forty teams submitted 413 predicted networks and measurement test sets. Overall, a handful of best-performer teams were identified, while a majority of teams made predictions that were equivalent to random. Counterintuitively, combining the predictions of multiple teams (including the weaker teams) can in some cases improve predictive power beyond that of any single method.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>DREAM provides valuable feedback to practitioners of systems biology modeling. Lessons learned from the predictions of the community provide much-needed context for interpreting claims of efficacy of algorithms described in the scientific literature.</p>

Synthetic datasets are therefore often needed to test the structure learning algorithms in a fast and reproducible manner. However, due to the lack of knowledge about the gene expression profiles, synthetic datasets may not resemble the biological reality. Here we present a computational tool, namely, ReTRN (Real Transcriptional Regulatory Networks) for extracting subnetworks from known transcription network and for generating corresponding gene expression data. By comparing with other implementations, we demonstrate that the network generated by ReTRN possesses scale free property, which resembles the biological reality. Moreover, ReTRN simultaneously generates gene expression data reflecting the temporal relationship in gene expression. We conclude that ReTRN provides a valid alternative to existing implementation and can be widely used in systems biology research.},

	Abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for Bayesian network structure learning, called Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC). The algorithm combines ideas from local learning, constraint-based, and search-and-score techniques in a principled and effective way. It first reconstructs the skeleton of a Bayesian network and then performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges. In our extensive empirical evaluation MMHC outperforms on average and in terms of various metrics several prototypical and state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the PC, Sparse Candidate, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, Greedy Equivalence Search, and Greedy Search. These are the first empirical results simultaneously comparing most of the major Bayesian network algorithms against each other. MMHC offers certain theoretical advantages, specifically over the Sparse Candidate algorithm, corroborated by our experiments. MMHC and detailed results of our study are publicly available at http://www.dsl-lag.org/supplements/mmhc\_paper/mmhc\_index.html.},

Clearly, the widely used standard covariance and correlation estimators are ill-suited for this purpose. As statistically efficient and computationally fast alternative we propose a novel shrinkage covariance estimator that exploits the Ledoit-Wolf (2003) lemma for analytic calculation of the optimal shrinkage intensity. Subsequently, we apply this improved covariance estimator (which has guaranteed minimum mean squared error, is well-conditioned, and is always positive definite even for small sample sizes) to the problem of inferring large-scale gene association networks. We show that it performs very favorably compared to competing approaches both in simulations as well as in application to real expression data.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic networks are often described statistically using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However, inferring the network structure offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis where the sample size is small compared to the number of considered genes. This renders many standard algorithms for graphical models inapplicable, and inferring genetic networks an 'ill-posed' inverse problem. METHODS: We introduce a novel framework for small-sample inference of graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically, we focus on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are now frequently used to describe gene association networks and to detect conditionally dependent genes. Our new approach is based on (1) improved (regularized) small-sample point estimates of partial correlation, (2) an exact test of edge inclusion with adaptive estimation of the degree of freedom and (3) a heuristic network search based on false discovery rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond to an empirical Bayes estimate of the network topology. RESULTS: Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity (power) and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed framework to estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that it is possible to recover the true network topology with high accuracy even for small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data from a breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach by inferring a corresponding large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.},

	Abstract = {{Although there has been a surge of interest in density estimation in recent years, much of the published research has been concerned with purely technical matters with insufficient emphasis given to the technique's practical value. Furthermore, the subject has been rather inaccessible to the general statistician.The account presented in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance, in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.}},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The use of correlation networks is widespread in the analysis of gene expression and proteomics data, even though it is known that correlations not only confound direct and indirect associations but also provide no means to distinguish between cause and effect. For 'causal' analysis typically the inference of a directed graphical model is required. However, this is rather difficult due to the curse of dimensionality.RESULTS:We propose a simple heuristic for the statistical learning of a high-dimensional 'causal' network. The method first converts a correlation network into a partial correlation graph. Subsequently, a partial ordering of the nodes is established by multiple testing of the log-ratio of standardized partial variances. This allows identifying a directed acyclic causal network as a subgraph of the partial correlation network. We illustrate the approach by analyzing a large Arabidopsis thaliana expression data set. CONCLUSIONS:The proposed approach is a heuristic algorithm that is based on a number of approximations, such as substituting lower order partial correlations by full order partial correlations. Nevertheless, for small samples and for sparse networks the algorithm not only yields sensible first order approximations of the causal structure in high-dimensional genomic data but is also computationally highly efficient. Availability and requirements: The method is implemented in the GeneNet R package (version 1.2.0), available from CRAN and from http://strimmerlab.org/software/genets/. The software includes an R script for reproducing the network analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana data.},

BioGRID is a freely accessible database of physical and genetic interactions available at http://www.thebiogrid.org. BioGRID release version 2.0 includes >116 000 interactions from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. Over 30 000 interactions have recently been added from 5778 sources through exhaustive curation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae primary literature. An internally hyper-linked web interface allows for rapid search and retrieval of interaction data. Full or user-defined datasets are freely downloadable as tab-delimited text files and PSI-MI XML. Pre-computed graphical layouts of interactions are available in a variety of file formats. User-customized graphs with embedded protein, gene and interaction attributes can be constructed with a visualization system called Osprey that is dynamically linked to the BioGRID.},

@article{ELMER2,
	Abstract = {Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation can be used to identify changes at transcriptional enhancers and other cis-regulatory elements in primary human samples. A systematic approach to inferring gene regulatory networks has been provided by the R/Bioconductor package ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), which first identifies DNA methylation changes in distal regulatory elements and correlates these with expression of nearby genes to identify direct transcriptional targets. Next, ELMER performs a transcription factor binding motif analysis and integrates with expression profiling of all human transcription factors, to identify master regulatory TFs and place each differentially methylated regulatory element into the context of an altered gene regulatory network (GRN). Here we present a completely updated version of the package (ELMER v. 2.0), which uses the latest Bioconductor data structures including the popular MultiAsssayExperiment, supports multiple reference genome assemblies as well as the DNA methylation platforms Infinium MethylationEPIC and Infinium HumanMethylation450, and provides a Supervised analysis mode for paired sample study designs (such as treated vs. untreated replicate samples). It also supports data import from the new NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) database. The new version is substantially re-written, improving stability, performance, and extensibility. It also uses improved databases for transcription factor binding domain families and binding motif specificities, and has newly designed output plots for publication-quality figures. Below, we describe the methods and new features of ELMER v. 2.0, and present two use case demonstrating how the tool can be used to analyze TCGA data in either Unsupervised or Supervised mode. ELMER (v2.0.0) is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://github.com/tiagochst/ELMER. Also, ELMER.data (v2.0.0), which provides auxiliary data required to perform the analysis, is available at https://github.com/tiagochst/ELMER.data.},

The portal reduces molecular profiling data from cancer tissues and cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, and proteomic events. The query interface combined with customized data storage enables researchers to interactively explore genetic alterations across samples, genes, and pathways and, when available in the underlying data, to link these to clinical outcomes. The portal provides graphical summaries of gene-level data from multiple platforms, network visualization and analysis, survival analysis, patient-centric queries, and software programmatic access. The intuitive Web interface of the portal makes complex cancer genomics profiles accessible to researchers and clinicians without requiring bioinformatics expertise, thus facilitating biological discoveries. Here, we provide a practical guide to the analysis and visualization features of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.},

Four different entropy estimators are made available in the package minet (empirical, Miller-Madow, Schurmann-Grassberger and shrink) as well as four different inference methods, namely relevance networks, ARACNE, CLR and MRNET. Also, the package integrates accuracy assessment tools, like F-scores, PR-curves and ROC-curves in order to compare the inferred network with a reference one.},

@article{Hau12,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Inferring the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN) from a collection of gene expression data has many potential applications, from the elucidation of complex biological processes to the identification of potential drug targets. It is however a notoriously difficult problem, for which the many existing methods reach limited accuracy.RESULTS:In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparse regression problem and investigate the performance of a popular feature selection method, least angle regression (LARS) combined with stability selection, for that purpose. We introduce a novel, robust and accurate scoring technique for stability selection, which improves the performance of feature selection with LARS. The resulting method, which we call TIGRESS (for Trustful Inference of Gene REgulation with Stability Selection), was ranked among the top GRN inference methods in the DREAM5 gene network inference challenge. In particular, TIGRESS was evaluated to be the best linear regression-based method in the challenge. We investigate in depth the influence of the various parameters of the method, and show that a fine parameter tuning can lead to significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance for GRN inference, in both directed and undirected settings.CONCLUSIONS:TIGRESS reaches state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data, including both in silico and in vivo (E. coli and S. cerevisiae) networks. This study confirms the potential of feature selection techniques for GRN inference. Code and data are available on http://cbio.ensmp.fr/tigress webcite. Moreover, TIGRESS can be run online through the GenePattern platform (GP-DREAM, http://dream.broadinstitute.org webcite).},

	Abstract = {The transcription factor {POU5f1}/{OCT4} controls pluripotency in mammalian {ES} cells, but little is known about its functions in the early embryo. We used time-resolved transcriptome analysis of zebrafish pou5f1 {MZspg} mutant embryos to identify genes regulated by Pou5f1. Comparison to mammalian systems defines evolutionary conserved Pou5f1 targets. Time-series data reveal many Pou5f1 targets with delayed or advanced onset of expression. We identify two Pou5f1-dependent mechanisms controlling developmental timing. First, several Pou5f1 targets are transcriptional repressors, mediating repression of differentiation genes in distinct embryonic compartments. We analyze her3 gene regulation as example for a repressor in the neural anlagen. Second, the dynamics of {SoxB1} group gene expression and Pou5f1-dependent regulation of her3 and {foxD3} uncovers differential requirements for {SoxB1} activity to control temporal dynamics of activation, and spatial distribution of targets in the embryo. We establish a mathematical model of the early Pou5f1 and {SoxB1} gene network to demonstrate regulatory characteristics important for developmental timing. The temporospatial structure of the zebrafish Pou5f1 target networks may explain aspects of the evolution of the mammalian stem cell networks.},

	Abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed for inferring gene regulatory networks from expression data, however, both their absolute and comparative performance remain poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework for critical performance assessment of methods for gene network inference. We present an in silico benchmark suite that we provided as a blinded, community-wide challenge within the context of the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) project. We assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference methods, which have been applied independently by participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that current inference methods are affected, to various degrees, by different types of systematic prediction errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this community-wide experiment show that reliable network inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved problem, and they indicate potential ways of network reconstruction improvements.},

	Abstract = {Summary: Independent of the platform and the analysis methods used, the result of a microarray experiment is, in most cases, a list of differentially expressed genes. An automatic ontological analysis approach has been recently proposed to help with the biological interpretation of such results. Currently, this approach is the de facto standard for the secondary analysis of high throughput experiments and a large number of tools have been developed for this purpose. We present a detailed comparison of 14 such tools using the following criteria: scope of the analysis, visualization capabilities, statistical model(s) used, correction for multiple comparisons, reference microarrays available, installation issues and sources of annotation data. This detailed analysis of the capabilities of these tools will help researchers choose the most appropriate tool for a given type of analysis. More importantly, in spite of the fact that this type of analysis has been generally adopted, this approach has several important intrinsic drawbacks. These drawbacks are associated with all tools discussed and represent conceptual limitations of the current state-of-the-art in ontological analysis. We propose these as challenges for the next generation of secondary data analysis tools.Contact: sod@cs.wayne.edu},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>An important problem in systems biology is to map gene networks, which help identify gene functions and discover critical disease pathways. Current methods for constructing gene networks have identified a number of biologically significant functional modules. However, these networks do not reveal directionality, that is, which gene regulates which, an important aspect of gene regulation. Radiation hybrid panels are a venerable method for high resolution genetic mapping. Recently we have used radiation hybrids to map loci based on their effects on gene expression. Because these regulatory loci are finely mapped, we can identify which gene turns on another gene, that is, directionality. In this paper, we constructed directed networks from radiation hybrid expression data. We found the radiation hybrid networks concordant with available datasets but also demonstrate that they can reveal information inaccessible to existing approaches. Importantly, directionality can help dissect cause and effect in genetic networks, aiding in understanding and ultimately rational intervention.</p>

@article{Sir12,
	Abstract = {<p>With the fast development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, a new generation of genome-wide gene expression measurements is under way. This is based on mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which complements the already mature technology of microarrays, and is expected to overcome some of the latter?s disadvantages. These RNA-seq data pose new challenges, however, as strengths and weaknesses have yet to be fully identified. Ideally, Next (or Second) Generation Sequencing measures can be integrated for more comprehensive gene expression investigation to facilitate analysis of whole regulatory networks. At present, however, the nature of these data is not very well understood. In this paper we study three alternative gene expression time series datasets for the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryo development, in order to compare three measurement techniques: RNA-seq, single-channel and dual-channel microarrays. The aim is to study the state of the art for the three technologies, with a view of assessing overlapping features, data compatibility and integration potential, in the context of time series measurements. This involves using established tools for each of the three different technologies, and technical and biological replicates (for RNA-seq and microarrays, respectively), due to the limited availability of biological RNA-seq replicates for time series data. The approach consists of a sensitivity analysis for differential expression and clustering. In general, the RNA-seq dataset displayed highest sensitivity to differential expression. The single-channel data performed similarly for the differentially expressed genes common to gene sets considered. Cluster analysis was used to identify different features of the gene space for the three datasets, with higher similarities found for the RNA-seq and single-channel microarray dataset.</p>},

@article{Chu02,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND Affymetrix microarrays have become increasingly popular in gene-expression studies; however, limitations of the technology have not been well established for commercially available arrays. The hybridization signal has been shown to be proportional to actual transcript concentration for specialized arrays containing hundreds of distinct probe pairs per gene. Additionally, the technology has been described as capable of distinguishing concentration levels within a factor of 2, and of detecting transcript frequencies as low as 1 in 2,000,000. Using commercially available arrays, we assessed these representations directly through a series of 'spike-in' hybridizations involving four prokaryotic transcripts in the absence and presence of fixed eukaryotic background. The contribution of probe-target interactions to the mismatch signal was quantified under various analyte concentrations. RESULTS A linear relationship between transcript abundance and signal was consistently observed between 1 pM and 10 pM transcripts. The signal ceased to be linear above the 10 pM level and commenced saturating around the 100 pM level. The 0.1 pM transcripts were virtually undetectable in the presence of eukaryotic background. Our measurements show that preponderance of the signal for mismatch probes derives from interactions with the target transcripts. CONCLUSIONS Landmark studies outlining an observed linear relationship between signal and transcript concentration were carried out under highly specialized conditions and may not extend to commercially available arrays under routine operating conditions. Additionally, alternative metrics that are not based on the difference in the signal of members of a probe pair may further improve the quantitative utility of the Affymetrix GeneChip array. },

Although such gene networks are phenomenological because they do not explicitly represent the proteins and metabolites that mediate cell interactions, they are a logical way of describing phenomena observed with transcription profiling, such as those that occur with popular microarray technology. The ability to create gene networks from experimental data and use them to reason about their dynamics and design principles will increase our understanding of cellular function. We propose that gene networks are also a good way to describe function unequivocally, and that they could be used for genome functional annotation. Here, we review some of the concepts and methods associated with gene networks, with emphasis on their construction based on experimental data.},

	Abstract = {
                Mutations in codon 12, 13, or 61 of one of the three ras genes, H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras, convert these genes into active oncogenes. Rapid assays for the detection of these point mutations have been developed recently and used to investigate the role mutated ras genes play in the pathogenesis of human tumors. It appeared that ras gene mutations can be found in a variety of tumor types, although the incidence varies greatly. The highest incidences are found in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (90\%), the colon (50\%), and the lung (30\%); in thyroid tumors (50\%); and in myeloid leukemia (30\%). For some tumor types a relationship may exist between the presence of a ras mutation and clinical or histopathological features of the tumor. There is some evidence that environmental agents may be involved in the induction of the mutations.

	Abstract = {Reconstructing gene regulatory networks from high-throughput data is a long-standing challenge. Through the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project, we performed a comprehensive blind assessment of over 30 network inference methods on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in silico microarray data. We characterize the performance, data requirements and inherent biases of different inference approaches, and we provide guidelines for algorithm application and development. We observed that no single inference method performs optimally across all data sets. In contrast, integration of predictions from multiple inference methods shows robust and high performance across diverse data sets. We thereby constructed high-confidence networks for E. coli and S. aureus, each comprising similar to 1,700 transcriptional interactions at a precision of similar to 50\%. We experimentally tested 53 previously unobserved regulatory interactions in E. coli, of which 23 (43\%) were supported. Our results establish community-based methods as a powerful and robust tool for the inference of transcriptional gene regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {We describe a computational protocol for the {ARACNE} algorithm, an information-theoretic method for identifying transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray expression profile data. Similar to other algorithms, {ARACNE} predicts potential functional associations among genes, or novel functions for uncharacterized genes, by identifying statistical dependencies between gene products. However, based on biochemical validation, literature searches and {DNA} binding site enrichment analysis, {ARACNE} has also proven effective in identifying bona fide transcriptional targets, even in complex mammalian networks. Thus we envision that predictions made by {ARACNE}, especially when supplemented with prior knowledge or additional data sources, can provide appropriate hypotheses for the further investigation of cellular networks. While the examples in this protocol use only gene expression profile data, the algorithm's theoretical basis readily extends to a variety of other high-throughput measurements, such as pathway-specific or genome-wide proteomics, {microRNA} and metabolomics data. As these data become readily available, we expect that {ARACNE} might prove increasingly useful in elucidating the underlying interaction models. For a microarray data set containing approximately 10,000 probes, reconstructing the network around a single probe completes in several minutes using a desktop computer with a Pentium 4 processor. Reconstructing a genome-wide network generally requires a computational cluster, especially if the recommended bootstrapping procedure is used.},

Gene regulatory networks (GRN) inferred from gene expression data are considered an important aid for this research by providing a map of molecular interactions. Hence, GRNs have the potential enabling and enhancing basic as well as applied research in the life sciences. In this paper, we introduce a new method called BC3NET for inferring causal gene regulatory networks from large-scale gene expression data. BC3NET is an ensemble method that is based on <italic>bagging</italic> the C3NET algorithm, which means it corresponds to a Bayesian approach with noninformative priors. In this study we demonstrate for a variety of simulated and biological gene expression data from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that BC3NET is an important enhancement over other inference methods that is capable of capturing biochemical interactions from transcription regulation and protein-protein interaction sensibly. An implementation of BC3NET is freely available as an R package from the CRAN repository.</p>},

Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is a particularly fast feature selection method for finding a set of both relevant and complementary features. Here we describe the mRMRe R package, in which the mRMR technique is extended by using an ensemble approach in order to better explore the feature space and build more robust predictors. To deal with the computational complexity of the ensemble approach the main functions of the package are implemented and parallelized in C using the openMP API.Results: Our ensemble mRMR implementations outperform the classical mRMR approach in terms of prediction accuracy. They identify genes more relevant to the biological context and may lead to richer biological interpretations. The parallelized functions included in the package show significant gains in terms of run-time speed when compared to previously released packages.Availability: The R package mRMRe is available on CRAN and is provided open source under the Artistic-2.0 License.

	Abstract = {Motivation: A major issue in computational biology is the reconstruction of
pathways from several genomic datasets, such as expression data,
protein interaction data and phylogenetic profiles. As a first
step toward this goal, it is important to investigate the amount
of correlation which exists between these data.Results: These methods are successfully tested on their ability to
recognize operons in the  Escherichia coli genome, from
the comparison of  three datasets corresponding to
functional relationships between genes in metabolic pathways,
geometrical relationships along the chromosome, and
co-expression relationships as observed by gene
expression data.Contact: yoshi@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp

@article{KEGG,
	Abstract = {{KEGG} (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the {GENES} database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the {PATHWAY} database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The {PATHWAY} database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in {KEGG} is {LIGAND} for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. {KEGG} provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ ).},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Inferring gene regulatory networks from large-scale expression data is an important problem that received much attention in recent years. These networks have the potential to gain insights into causal molecular interactions of biological processes. Hence, from a methodological point of view, reliable estimation methods based on observational data are needed to approach this problem practically.RESULTS:In this paper, we introduce a novel gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) algorithm, called C3NET. We compare C3NET with four well known methods, ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and RN, conducting in-depth numerical ensemble simulations and demonstrate also for biological expression data from E. coli that C3NET performs consistently better than the best known GRNI methods in the literature. In addition, it has also a low computational complexity. Since C3NET is based on estimates of mutual information values in conjunction with a maximization step, our numerical investigations demonstrate that our inference algorithm exploits causal structural information in the data efficiently.CONCLUSIONS:For systems biology to succeed in the long run, it is of crucial importance to establish methods that extract large-scale gene networks from high-throughput data that reflect the underlying causal interactions among genes or gene products. Our method can contribute to this endeavor by demonstrating that an inference algorithm with a neat design permits not only a more intuitive and possibly biological interpretation of its working mechanism but can also result in superior results.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the technique designated best performer in the 2nd conference on Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods ({DREAM2}) Challenge 5 (unsigned genome-scale network prediction from blinded microarray data). Existing algorithms use the pairwise correlations of the expression levels of genes, which provide valuable but insufficient information for the inference of regulatory interactions. Here we present a computational approach based on the recently developed context likelihood of related ({CLR}) algorithm, extracting additional complementary information using the information theoretic measure of synergy and assigning a score to each ordered pair of genes measuring the degree of confidence that the first gene regulates the second. When tested on a set of publicly available Escherichia coli gene-expression data with known assumed ground truth, the synergy augmented {CLR} ({SA}-{CLR}) algorithm had significantly improved prediction performance when compared to {CLR}. There is also enhanced potential for biological discovery as a result of the identification of the most likely synergistic partner genes involved in the interactions.},

	Abstract = {Diseases such as cancer are often related to collaborative effects involving interactions of multiple genes within complex pathways, or to combinations of multiple {SNPs}. To understand the structure of such mechanisms, it is helpful to analyze genes in terms of the purely cooperative, as opposed to independent, nature of their contributions towards a phenotype. Here, we present an information-theoretic analysis that provides a quantitative measure of the multivariate synergy and decomposes sets of genes into submodules each of which contains synergistically interacting genes. When the resulting computational tools are used for the analysis of gene expression or {SNP} data, this systems-based methodology provides insight into the biological mechanisms responsible for disease.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian Networks ({BN}) is a knowledge representation formalism that has been proven to be valuable in biomedicine for constructing decision support systems and for generating causal hypotheses from data. Given the emergence of datasets in medicine and biology with thousands of variables and that current algorithms do not scale more than a few hundred variables in practical domains, new efficient and accurate algorithms are needed to learn high quality {BNs} from data. We present a new algorithm called {Max-Min} {Hill-Climbing} ({MMHC}) that builds upon and improves the Sparse Candidate ({SC}) algorithm; a state-of-the-art algorithm that scales up to datasets involving hundreds of variables provided the generating networks are sparse. Compared to the {SC}, on a number of datasets from medicine and biology, (a) {MMHC} discovers {BNs} that are structurally closer to the data-generating {BN}, (b) the discovered networks are more probable given the data, (c) {MMHC} is computationally more efficient and scalable than {SC}, and (d) the generating networks are not required to be uniformly sparse nor is the user of {MMHC} required to guess correctly the network connectivity},

So people can use covariance matrix with multivariate normal distribution assumption to find independencies. In this paper, it showed another neighborhood selection scheme for sparse high-dimensional graphs with the Lasso. Neighborhood selection ? cast to Standard regression problem ? solved by Lasso , lasso: when p is 1, ridge: when p is 2. It is well known that the estimates have a parsimonious property for p <=1 only, while the optimization problem is only convex for p >=1. Larger lambda tends to shrink the size of the estimated set. Lasso coefficient estimation is not necessarily unique, but if uniqueness fails, the set of solutions is still convex and all our results about neighborhoods hold for any solution. The probability of falsely including nodes into the neighborhood estimate for node a is vanishing exponentially fast. ? The probability of including all neighboring variables into the estimate converges to 1. Consistent neighborhood estimation with the Lasso is possible but asymptotic considerations give little advice on how to choose the penalty parameter. Covariance Selection. We can estimate neighborhood of each node consistently Apply neighborhood selection to each node in the graph and estimate of the edge set E of graph G is then given by},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:DNA microarrays and other genomics-inspired technologies provide large datasets that often include hidden patterns of correlation between genes reflecting the complex processes that underlie cellular metabolism and physiology. The challenge in analyzing large-scale expression data has been to extract biologically meaningful inferences regarding these processes - often represented as networks - in an environment where the datasets are often imperfect and biological noise can obscure the actual signal. Although many techniques have been developed in an attempt to address these issues, to date their ability to extract meaningful and predictive network relationships has been limited. Here we describe a method that draws on prior information about gene-gene interactions to infer biologically relevant pathways from microarray data. Our approach consists of using preliminary networks derived from the literature and/or protein-protein interaction data as seeds for a Bayesian network analysis of microarray results.RESULTS:Through a bootstrap analysis of gene expression data derived from a number of leukemia studies, we demonstrate that seeded Bayesian Networks have the ability to identify high-confidence gene-gene interactions which can then be validated by comparison to other sources of pathway data.CONCLUSION:The use of network seeds greatly improves the ability of Bayesian Network analysis to learn gene interaction networks from gene expression data. We demonstrate that the use of seeds derived from the biomedical literature or high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, or the combination, provides improvement over a standard Bayesian Network analysis, allowing networks involving dynamic processes to be deduced from the static snapshots of biological systems that represent the most common source of microarray data. Software implementing these methods has been included in the widely used TM4 microarray analysis package.},

	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A major challenge of systems biology is to infer biochemical interactions from large-scale observations, such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We propose to use a partial correlation analysis to construct approximate Undirected Dependency Graphs from such large-scale biochemical data. This approach enables a distinction between direct and indirect interactions of biochemical compounds, thereby inferring the underlying network topology. {RESULTS}: The method is first thoroughly evaluated with a large set of simulated data. Results indicate that the approach has good statistical power and a low False Discovery Rate even in the presence of noise in the data. We then applied the method to an existing data set of yeast gene expression. Several small gene networks were inferred and found to contain genes known to be collectively involved in particular biochemical processes. In some of these networks there are also uncharacterized {ORFs} present, which lead to hypotheses about their functions. {AVAILABILITY}: Programs running in {MS}-Windows and Linux for applying zeroth, first, second and third order partial correlation analysis can be downloaded at: {http://mendes.vbi.vt.edu/tiki-index.php?page=Software}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary information can be found at: {URL} to be decided.},

                Gene regulatory network models are a major area of study in systems and computational biology and the construction of network models is among the most important problems in these disciplines. The critical epistemological issue concerns validation. Validity can be approached from two different perspectives (i) given a hypothesized network model, its scientific validity relates to the ability to make predictions from the model that can be checked against experimental observations; and (ii) the validity of a network inference procedure must be evaluated relative to its ability to infer a network from sample points generated by the network. This article examines both perspectives in the framework of a distance function between two networks. It considers some of the obstacles to validation and provides examples of both validation paradigms.

	Abstract = {
                {MOTIVATION}: An important problem in systems biology is reconstructing complete networks of interactions between biological objects by extrapolating from a few known interactions as examples. While there are many computational techniques proposed for this network reconstruction task, their accuracy is consistently limited by the small number of high-confidence examples, and the uneven distribution of these examples across the potential interaction space, with some objects having many known interactions and others few. {RESULTS}: To address this issue, we propose two computational methods based on the concept of training set expansion. They work particularly effectively in conjunction with kernel approaches, which are a popular class of approaches for fusing together many disparate types of features. Both our methods are based on semi-supervised learning and involve augmenting the limited number of gold-standard training instances with carefully chosen and highly confident auxiliary examples. The first method, prediction propagation, propagates highly confident predictions of one local model to another as the auxiliary examples, thus learning from information-rich regions of the training network to help predict the information-poor regions. The second method, kernel initialization, takes the most similar and most dissimilar objects of each object in a global kernel as the auxiliary examples. Using several sets of experimentally verified protein-protein interactions from yeast, we show that training set expansion gives a measurable performance gain over a number of representative, state-of-the-art network reconstruction methods, and it can correctly identify some interactions that are ranked low by other methods due to the lack of training examples of the involved proteins.

Performing genetic studies frequently results in large lists of candidate genes of which only few can be followed up for further investigation. We have recently developed a computational method for constitutional genetic disorders that identifies the most promising candidate genes by replacing prior knowledge by experimental data of differential gene expression between affected and healthy {individuals.To} improve the performance of our prioritization strategy, we have extended our previous work by applying different machine learning approaches that identify promising candidate genes by determining whether a gene is surrounded by highly differentially expressed genes in a functional association or protein-protein interaction {network.RESULTS}:We have proposed three strategies scoring disease candidate genes relying on network-based machine learning approaches, such as kernel ridge regression, heat kernel, and Arnoldi kernel approximation. For comparison purposes, a local measure based on the expression of the direct neighbors is also computed. We have benchmarked these strategies on 40 publicly available knockout experiments in mice, and performance was assessed against results obtained using a standard procedure in genetics that ranks candidate genes based solely on their differential expression levels (Simple Expression Ranking). Our results showed that our four strategies could outperform this standard procedure and that the best results were obtained using the Heat Kernel Diffusion Ranking leading to an average ranking position of 8 out of 100 genes, an {AUC} value of 92.3\% and an error reduction of 52.8\% relative to the standard procedure approach which ranked the knockout gene on average at position 17 with an {AUC} value of {83.7\%.CONCLUSION}:In this study we could identify promising candidate genes using network based machine learning approaches even if no knowledge is available about the disease or phenotype.},

	Abstract = {Genetic studies (in particular linkage and association studies) identify chromosomal regions involved in a disease or phenotype of interest, but those regions often contain many candidate genes, only a few of which can be followed-up for biological validation. Recently, computational methods to identify (prioritize) the most promising candidates within a region have been proposed, but they are usually not applicable to cases where little is known about the phenotype (no or few confirmed disease genes, fragmentary understanding of the biological cascades involved). We seek to overcome this limitation by replacing knowledge about the biological process by experimental data on differential gene expression between affected and healthy individuals. Considering the problem from the perspective of a gene/protein network, we assess a candidate gene by considering the level of differential expression in its neighborhood under the assumption that strong candidates will tend to be surrounded by differentially expressed neighbors. We define a notion of soft neighborhood where each gene is given a contributing weight, which decreases with the distance from the candidate gene on the protein network. To account for multiple paths between genes, we define the distance using the Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel. We score candidates by aggregating the differential expression of neighbors weighted as a function of distance. Through a randomization procedure, we rank candidates by p-values. We illustrate our approach on four monogenic diseases and successfully prioritize the known disease causing genes.},

	Abstract = {
                Most common genetic disorders have a complex inheritance and may result from variants in many genes, each contributing only weak effects to the disease. Pinpointing these disease genes within the myriad of susceptibility loci identified in linkage studies is difficult because these loci may contain hundreds of genes. However, in any disorder, most of the disease genes will be involved in only a few different molecular pathways. If we know something about the relationships between the genes, we can assess whether some genes (which may reside in different loci) functionally interact with each other, indicating a joint basis for the disease etiology. There are various repositories of information on pathway relationships. To consolidate this information, we developed a functional human gene network that integrates information on genes and the functional relationships between genes, based on data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, Reactome, the Human Protein Reference Database, the Gene Ontology database, predicted protein-protein interactions, human yeast two-hybrid interactions, and microarray co-expressions. We applied this network to interrelate positional candidate genes from different disease loci and then tested 96 heritable disorders for which the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database reported at least three disease genes. Artificial susceptibility loci, each containing 100 genes, were constructed around each disease gene, and we used the network to rank these genes on the basis of their functional interactions. By following up the top five genes per artificial locus, we were able to detect at least one known disease gene in 54\% of the loci studied, representing a 2.8-fold increase over random selection. This suggests that our method can significantly reduce the cost and effort of pinpointing true disease genes in analyses of disorders for which numerous loci have been reported but for which most of the genes are unknown.

	Abstract = {We construct a gene-to-gene regulatory network from time-series data of expression levels for the whole genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae, in a case where the number of measurements is much smaller than the number of genes in the network. This network is analyzed with respect to present biological knowledge of all genes (according to the Gene Ontology database), and we find some of its large-scale properties to be in accordance with known facts about the organism. The linear modeling employed here has been explored several times, but due to lack of any validation beyond investigating individual genes, it has been seriously questioned with respect to its applicability to biological systems. Our results show the adequacy of the approach and make further investigations of the model meaningful.},

	Abstract = {
<p>One methodology that has met success to infer gene networks from gene expression data is based upon ordinary differential equations (ODE). However new types of data continue to be produced, so it is worthwhile to investigate how to integrate these new data types into the inference procedure. One such data is physical interactions between transcription factors and the genes they regulate as measured by ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq experiments. These interactions can be incorporated into the gene network inference procedure as a priori network information. In this article, we extend the ODE methodology into a general optimization framework that incorporates existing network information in combination with regularization parameters that encourage network sparsity. We provide theoretical results proving convergence of the estimator for our method and show the corresponding probabilistic interpretation also converges. We demonstrate our method on simulated network data and show that existing network information improves performance, overcomes the lack of observations, and performs well even when some of the existing network information is incorrect. We further apply our method to the core regulatory network of embryonic stem cells utilizing predicted interactions from two studies as existing network information. We show that including the prior network information constructs a more closely representative regulatory network versus when no information is provided.</p>

	Abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

@article{Mar10,
	Abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed for inferring gene
                 regulatory networks from expression data, however, both
                 their absolute and comparative performance remain poorly
                 understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework for
                 critical performance assessment of methods for gene
                 network inference. We present an in silico benchmark
                 suite that we provided as a blinded, community-wide
                 challenge within the context of the DREAM (Dialogue on
                 Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) project. We
                 assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference
                 methods, which have been applied independently by
                 participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that
                 current inference methods are affected, to various
                 degrees, by different types of systematic prediction
                 errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method
                 failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs
                 (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this
                 community-wide experiment show that reliable network
                 inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved
                 problem, and they indicate potential ways of network
                 reconstruction improvements.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering co-expressed genes usually requires the definition of 'distance' or 'similarity' between measured datasets, the most common choices being Pearson correlation or Euclidean distance. With the size of available datasets steadily increasing, it has become feasible to consider other, more general, definitions as well. One alternative, based on information theory, is the mutual information, providing a general measure of dependencies between variables. While the use of mutual information in cluster analysis and visualization of large-scale gene expression data has been suggested previously, the earlier studies did not focus on comparing different algorithms to estimate the mutual information from finite data. RESULTS: Here we describe and review several approaches to estimate the mutual information from finite datasets. Our findings show that the algorithms used so far may be quite substantially improved upon. In particular when dealing with small datasets, finite sample effects and other sources of potentially misleading results have to be taken into account.},

sequences with long range correlations. In particular, we consider algorithms
which estimate h from the code lengths produced by some compression algorithm.
Our interest is in describing their convergence with sequence length, assuming
no limits for the space and time complexities of the compression algorithms. A
scaling law is proposed for extrapolation from finite sample lengths. This is
applied to sequences of dynamical systems in non-trivial chaotic regimes, a 1-D
cellular automaton, and to written English texts.},

@article{Bro09,
	Abstract = {We address the problem of improving the reliability of independence-based causal discovery algorithms that results from the execution of statistical independence tests on small data sets, which typically have low reliability. We model the problem as a knowledge base containing a set of independence facts that are related through Pearl's well-known axioms. Statistical tests on finite data sets may result in errors in these tests and inconsistencies in the knowledge base. We resolve these inconsistencies through the use of an instance of the class of defeasible logics called argumentation, augmented with a preference function, that is used to reason about and possibly correct errors in these tests. This results in a more robust conditional independence test, called an argumentative independence test. Our experimental evaluation shows clear positive improvements in the accuracy of argumentative over purely statistical tests. We also demonstrate significant improvements on the accuracy of causal structure discovery from the outcomes of independence tests both on sampled data from randomly generated causal models and on real-world data sets.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, a few researchers have challenged past dogma and suggested methods (such as the IC algorithm) for inferring causal relationship among variables using steady state observations. In this paper, we present a modified IC (mIC) algorithm that uses entropy to test conditional independence and combines the steady state data with partial prior knowledge of topological ordering in gene regulatory network, for jointly learning the causal relationship among genes. We evaluate our mIC algorithm using the simulated data. The results show that the precision and recall rates are significantly improved compared with using IC algorithm. Finally, we apply the mIC algorithm to microarray data for melanoma. The algorithm identified the important causal relations associated with WNT5A, a gene playing an important role in melanoma, verified by the literatures.},

@article{Syn,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of algorithms to infer the structure of gene regulatory networks based on expression data is an important subject in bioinformatics research. Validation of these algorithms requires benchmark data sets for which the underlying network is known. Since experimental data sets of the appropriate size and design are usually not available, there is a clear need to generate well-characterized synthetic data sets that allow thorough testing of learning algorithms in a fast and reproducible manner. RESULTS: In this paper we describe a network generator that creates synthetic transcriptional regulatory networks and produces simulated gene expression data that approximates experimental data. Network topologies are generated by selecting subnetworks from previously described regulatory networks. Interaction kinetics are modeled by equations based on Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics. Our results show that the statistical properties of these topologies more closely approximate those of genuine biological networks than do those of different types of random graph models. Several user-definable parameters adjust the complexity of the resulting data set with respect to the structure learning algorithms. CONCLUSION: This network generation technique offers a valid alternative to existing methods. The topological characteristics of the generated networks more closely resemble the characteristics of real transcriptional networks. Simulation of the network scales well to large networks. The generator models different types of biological interactions and produces biologically plausible synthetic gene expression data.},

	Abstract = {Increasing numbers of methodologies are available to find functional genomic clusters in RNA expression data. We describe a technique that computes comprehensive pair-wise mutual information for all genes in such a data set. An association with a high mutual information means that one gene is non-randomly associated with another; we hypothesize this means the two are related biologically. By picking a threshold mutual information and using only associations at or above the threshold, we show how this technique was used on a public data set of 79 RNA expression measurements of 2,467 genes to construct 22 clusters, or Relevance Networks. The biological significance of each Relevance Network is explained.},

Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.},

@book{Pea00,
	Abstract = {{Written by one of the pre-eminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Pearl presents a unified account of the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual and structural approaches to causation, and devises simple mathematical tools for analyzing the relationships between causal connections, statistical associations, actions and observations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curriculum of statistics, artifical intelligence, business, epidemiology, social science and economics. Students in these areas will find natural models, simple identification procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have tended to evade or make unduly complicated. This book will be of interest to professionals and students in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.}},
